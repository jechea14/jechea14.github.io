          I am a budding front-end software engineer with a background in computer engineering. 
          I started my journey as a software developer after obtaining my computer engineering degree from San Jose State University.

          I learned Python and enjoyed it from building web scrapers and APIs and wanted to go into back-end web development with Python.  
          However, I became very interested in front-end development while developing my web scrapers as I wanted to display data on a webpage.
          After learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other front-end technologies, I fell in love with frontend and wanted to learn more about the front-end world and pursue front-end web development as a software engineer.

          I've discovered my passion in the web development world and the beauty of building wonderful web applications.
          I love coding and solving problems through code, and I am excited to work alongside other engineers and learn so much more!
          I'm looking for opportunities in junior/new grad front-end web development positions to start my career and learn among professionals.
